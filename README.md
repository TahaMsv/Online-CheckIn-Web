Online check-in is a process through which passengers confirm their presence on a flight via the internet prior to arriving at the airport. This typically involves accessing the airline's website or mobile app, entering booking details, and selecting seats. Online check-in can often be done within a specific timeframe before the flight departure and allows passengers to print their boarding passes or receive electronic ones on their mobile devices, enabling smoother and faster airport procedures.
